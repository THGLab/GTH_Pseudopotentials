# GTH_Pseudopotentials and MOLOPT_Basis Sets
<pre>
GTH-PARAMETER_B97M-rV & GTH-PARAMETER_wB97X-V:
</pre>
Provided herein are the optimized GTH pseudopotentials (PPs) at the levels of meta-GGA B97M-rV and hybrid ωB97X-V, tailored for main-group elements and metals including transition metals and noble metals.
<pre>
BASIS_MOLOPT_B97M-rV & BASIS_MOLOPT_wB97X-V: 
</pre>
Corresponding MOLOPT basis sets optimized at B97M-rV and ωB97X-V ranging from DZVP, TZVP to TZVPPD levels, used together with the corresponding GTH PPs.
</pre>
GTH-PARAMETER_B97M-rV_NLCC: 
</pre>
NLCC parameters are applicable to second-row elements at the B97M-rV level, for elements of greater atomic number, it is advisable to utilize the conventional GTH PPs.
